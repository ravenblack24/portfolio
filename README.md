## Try it
[See my portfolio website](https:imkp.co.uk).

Note: The microservice projects are hosted on repl.co and seem to go inactive from time to time...it may be best to download and run these locally.

## General info
This site gives a brief overview of me, some of the projects I have built and the technologies used, as well as a skill summary and contact form.  Links within the footer direct to my GitHub repository, Codewars profile and freeCodeCamp profile.

## Technologies
* HTML, SASS and jQuery

## Status
Initial build is complete and [the site is available here](https:imkp.co.uk).

The following items are on my to-do list:
* Add project filter
* Add project detail pages (maybe)
